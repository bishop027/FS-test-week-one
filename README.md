# Full Stack Development Test - Week One

This assessment tests your understanding of loops, objects, arrays, and basic functions.

## Guidelines

- In case you copy previously written code, you should be able to explain it on the white board

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade  | Explanation              |
| :----: | -------------------------|
|   4    | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3    | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2    | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer. |
|   1    | I am struggling with this question. |
|   0    | I did not attempt this question (explain why) |

### 1. Palindrome

- Grade: 4
- Explanation: We recently completed a similar exercise in the previous class, so I was able to solve the problem step by step.

### 2. Add grid items

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I felt like I understood the question and I was able to form a plan on how to solve the problem; however, I completely forgot how grids worked and needed to look up quite a few things, which left me with less time.

### 3. Create file name string in CamelCase

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I understood the question, but I'm unsure if my answer is correct.

### 4. Create pattern

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I definitley think I overthought this question and used the majority on my time to answer it. I'm not sure what happened, but I feel like the hint made me more confused that I was originally. 


*** Quick note - my browser crashed and my whole computer wouldn't start after the looping exercise. Unfortunately, I needed to reboot my computer. I lost a lot of time, so I went back to the exercises after this happened.
